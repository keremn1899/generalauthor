/**
 * Which edge label is under the pointer — asked of the drawing, not of G6.
 *
 * An edge on these canvases refuses the pointer along its stroke, deliberately:
 * a filament is drawn *through* the discs it joins, so a line that caught
 * clicks would steal them from the marks it runs between. The name it carries
 * is a different matter — a plate with a word on it is the most clickable
 * thing on the canvas, and for a binary claim it is the *only* drawing of that
 * claim, because a bond has no chip.
 *
 * G6 will not deliver those clicks. `labelPointerEvents: "auto"` is set, the
 * custom edge's `getLabelStyle` sets `pointerEvents: "auto"` on the drawn
 * label, and the picker still does not route to it: the key path opted out and
 * the label group does not always join the same hit-test path. This was found
 * once already, for the bundle count, and worked around there alone — which is
 * why every other named edge on both canvases could be read in a table and not
 * opened by clicking the name sitting on the canvas.
 *
 * So the label the renderer already drew is the authority for where its word
 * is. This runs once per click, not per pointer move.

 * is stated in screen pixels and divided by the zoom, because a constant in
 * graph space is a target that shrinks as the drawing is pushed away, which is
