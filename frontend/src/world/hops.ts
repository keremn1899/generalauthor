/**
 * Graph distance across the field, for the light law.
 *
 * "Near" on this surface cannot mean *close on screen*. Two marks a thousand
 * pixels apart but joined by one relation are neighbours; two that happen to
 * overlap after a drag are strangers. So distance is hops, and zooming or
 * dragging changes nothing about what is lit.
 *
 * Every drawn mark is a node and every drawn connection is an edge of length
 * one, which decides the two cases that are otherwise arguable:
 *
 * - A **plate** stands between its referents with a spoke to each, so two
 *   referents joined through it are two hops apart. That is right: what joins
 *   them is a third thing, and you can point at it.
 * - A **bond** is the line itself. It touches both discs, so the discs are one
 *   hop apart and the bond is one hop from each. A folded tuple should not
 *   read as further away than the same tuple unfolded would.
 *
 * Furniture — a shelf under a chip, a crown over one — is not a mark. It takes
 * the light of the chip it hangs off, which `WorldCanvas` resolves by name.
