/**
 * The windowing arithmetic, once.
 *
 * Two surfaces draw long lists of rows — a relation's extension and the
 * unresolved frontier — and both do it the same way: a scroller whose spacer is
 * the full height of the list, rows positioned absolutely against it, and only
 * the ones the viewport stands on in the DOM. What differs between them is
 * where the rows come from, which is the interesting part; the index
 * arithmetic is not, and two copies of it would drift the moment one of them
 * grew a bug.
 *
 * The height is observed rather than assumed, because the drawer is sized as a
 * fraction of a stage that changes when the panel or the window does. A window
 * computed against a stale height is a window that stops short of the rows a
 * person is looking at.
