/**
 * Absorb, then change, then emit — with a gap in the middle on purpose.
 *
 * `Swap` overlaps its two halves, and that is right when both subjects are
 * painted on the same ground: the outgoing copy and the incoming one are the
 * same kind of thing in the same colours, so seeing both at once reads as one
 * being exchanged for the other.
 *
 * Vocabulary focus is not that. It rewrites `--canvas`, `--panel`, `--ink`,
 * `--ink-muted` and `--rule` to a black field — `GRAPH_DNA_FOCUS` — so in
 * light mode the whole surface inverts. Overlapping the halves there would
 * paint the departing field in its own colours against a ground that had
 * already become the other one's: for the length of the cross-fade, one of the
 * two views is drawn wrong. And the palette itself cannot cross-fade —
 * `STILL_RULES.themeSnaps`: tweening every colour on a surface at once makes
 * the whole product briefly untrue.
 *
 * So the halves are sequenced instead. The old view absorbs to nothing, the
 * change lands while there is nothing drawn to be wrong, and the new view
 * emits. It costs `absorb + emit` rather than `emit`, which is the honest
 * price of a change that has no shared ground to cross over.
 *
 * The value returned is the one to *render*. The caller keeps its own state as
 * the intent — what a person asked for — and reads this for what is on screen,
 * which during the gap is still the old one.
