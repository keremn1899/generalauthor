/**
 * Light — the second law, and the one that had to be rewritten.
 *
 * The first version was a spotlight. A source lit what a person had acted on,
 * fell off inverse-square through the graph, and everything beyond reach sat
 * at an ambient floor of 0.34. It was coherent and it was wrong, for a reason
 * worth keeping written down: **a vignette makes a claim about the marks
 * outside it.** Dropping seven of eight disconnected seeds to a third of their
 * opacity because the pointer is on the eighth says those seven are less
 * present, and they are not — nothing about them changed. The person looked
 * somewhere. The world did not move.
 *
 * There was a second, quieter fault. `opacity` on a shape composites its fill
 * and its stroke separately, so a disc whose stroke is its fill colour grows a
 * visible darker rim the moment it is drawn below 1 — the dimming invented an
 * outline on a mark that is supposed to read as a mass.
 *
 * So light lifts and never dims:
 *
 * ```text
 * lit    = albedo + (1 - albedo) * lift(hops)
 * lift   = LIFT / (1 + hops / falloff)^2
 * ```
 *
 * A mark already at 1 is untouched, which is most of them. What moves is what
 * rests below 1 — an unnamed filament, a quiet spoke — and near the acted-on
 * mark those come *up*. The result is the neighbourhood becoming more present
 * rather than the rest becoming less, and at rest, with nothing acted on, the
 * law changes nothing at all.
 *
 * `LIFT` is deliberately small. This is meant to be noticed only if you look
 * for it; anything strong enough to read as a highlight is doing the ants' job
 * with the wrong instrument.
